The Player's Role
----------------------
----------------------
player's perspective
----------------------

The Player assumes the role of a deity whose duty is to protect all the creatures of the world who are virtuous, brave, and pure of heart.

Villages, towns, and cities will send their prayers to the player in the hopes that he/she will be inspired to give them divine aid. The player can choose to hear the prayers of the aforementioned communities, and protect them from harm. The player controls a divine shield of many shapes, and uses it to defend against attacks from the forces of evil that would threaten the good creatures of the world. The player can use their Divine shield to absorb attacks meant for the village, or reflect the malicious attacks back towards the creature who launched it. The player can draw upon their divine power to launch attacks against attacking forces.

If the player should fail to protect the creatures who called upon him/her for aid, the people of the world will lose faith in the player.

Developer's Perspective
----------------------

Putting the player into the shoes of a God/Goddess helps to immerse the player, and will make them feel powerful. Players have many pre-conceived notions about deities, and the game will play with these notions. People associate deities with power, and omnipotence, and those feelings will translate to the player since the player controls the most powerful element of the game, and will be able to see and know things that the characters of the game do not. Additionally, casting the player into the role of a deity will help to form a bond between the player and the digital characters in the game. The player may feel responsible for the creatures, and will feel heightened feelings of joy when they defend their worshippers successfully, and will feel the loss should they fail. On the flip-side, the player may enjoy acting as a careless and dominant God/Goddess who sees the characters as peons who are beneath them, and will enjoy seeing them grovel for the player's help.


The player controls a "shield" that can move along a horizontal axis near the bottom of the game field. The creature(s) that serve as a stage's antagonist will launch attacks of varying types at the player, which the player can absorb and/or reflect back towards it. If the player absorbs the antagonist's attack, they will be rewarded with Divine Essence. The player can use their collected Divine Essence to activate spells and abilities of their own. DE spells and abilities cost a set amount of DE points to activate.

Faith is a game convention that quantifies the player's current level of power. Every time the player successfully defends the forces of good, they will be rewarded with Faith points(FP). FP can also by earned through collecting specific power-ups, or by demanding a tithe of gold from worshippers. When the player acquires set amounts of FP, they will acquire a new Faith Level. The player is rewarded for advancing their Faith Level with access to new areas, abilities, and features of the game.

The game does not end if the player fails, but there are consequences for failure. Failing to defend the forces of good against from harm will result in a loss of FP. FP can not be negative, so the player will not lose additional FP if already at 0 FP. The player's FP is reset to 0 every time they level up, so it is impossible to De-level to a lower Faith Level.

Antagonist's Role
----------------------
----------------------
player's perspective
----------------------

Various forces of evil will attempt to attack villages throughout the game world. These Forces of Evil come in many shapes, sizes and types. One stage may see the player facing off against packs of bloodthirsty Lion monsters, another might pit players against the marauding hordes of rival armies. The player may even find themselves protecting their worshippers from jealous Gods and Goddesses. Many encounters will be of moderate or easy difficulty, but others will demand quick-reflexes and skilled use of Divine Powers against an intelligent and ruthless foe.

As the player progresses ever higher in the game the antagonist's they face will grow more and more powerful and spectacular.

----------------------
Developer's Perspective
----------------------

The Forces of Evil the player's face will really end up being the stars of the game. From a gameplay perspective, they introduce more dynamism into the game than any other element, since each one will require particular strategies and skills to defeat.

The various Forces of Evil(FoEs) will likely represent the team's greatest challenge.

For designers, keeping FoEs fresh and interesting will require that significant thought and care be put into each one. Each FoE should feel like a new experience to the player. In particular, Boss FoE's should present wholly new experiences to the player. It's important that the designers avoid "recycling" ideas from one FoE to the next.

This will be done by first and foremost keeping the types of FoEs varied. For example, a cyclops should act in a very different way that a Dragon would. Variation can also be introduced through the FoE's attacks. Some FoEs may favor hanging toward the back and launching magical attacks at the player, others may attempt to attack the player directly through melee strikes, while still others may attempt to disrupt the player's strategies by stealing their DE or "Debuffing" (ie. Shrinking the paddle, causing player to do diminished damage, causing the play area to go dark for brief periods of time.) them.

To simplify the FoE design process, it will help to think about what archetype the FoE should have. Dungeons and Dragons 4th ed. introduced several monster archetypes that can help the design process.

Strikers - Melee combatants who are nimble and quick. Relatively low Damage tolerance compared to their ability to deal damage.
Blasters - Artillery. Blasters enjoy throwing highly damaging spells and projectiles at the player's village from a distance. Low damage tolerance.
Brutes - These guys can take abuse, but aren't very effective at dishing it out. High Damage tolerance, low damage output.
Mesmerists - Creatures who delight in disorienting and weakening the player. They use spells that cause minimal direct damage, but cause ailments that affect the player in a variety of negative ways.
Minions - Also known as trash mobs. These guys do low damage and can't take much damage. They exist mainly for the visceral thrill that comes with defeating waves and waves of enemies.


These archetypes are not hard and fast rules for FoE design, and are merely meant to give the designers a starting point. In fact, the most interesting FoE designs may be hybrids, or creatures who don't play by the rules of any archetype at all!

----------------------
Village's Role
----------------------

----------------------
player's perspective
----------------------

The villages must be protected! They need you! Without you they are powerless!

The player can travel to various villages, towns, and cities in need and offer their protection. Some villages will offer quests can be undertaken for bonus FP and Gold. These quests can range from silly bonus missions (ie. a non-believer doubts your power, and explains that he won't believe in you unless you are able to use every available Divine Power in your arsenal during a single encounter), to the extreme (ie. A village leader explains that they've foolishly built their town so that the orphanages and old folks homes are on the village perimeter, and begs you to keep the town unharmed for the entire encounter to prevent the deaths of those inside).

Players will have the option to spend their available gold to upgrade villages and towns. Upgrading the villages will provide a variety of fun and useful bonues to the player during their encounters with the Forces of Evil.

----------------------
Designer's perspective
----------------------

If the FoEs are the star of the game, then the villages are the supporting actors. They give the player a purpose, and will give them characters to connect and identify with.

Additionally, the quests that villages offer can serve as a vehicle to tell an ongoing story, or simply offer some additional flavor and challenge to the game.

The player can select specific villages to interact with by selecting them from a World Map interface. Villages that are currently under siege by the forces of evil will have an exclamation point icon nect to its name, and a text bubble will float above it that displays various cries for help.

Selecting a Village from the world map will open a menu which players can interact with to launch into an encounter if the village is under siege, upgrade the village, or battle against old FoEs for fun, gold, and FP.

The village will progress along with the player. This will give the player a sense of accomplishment, as it will be fun to see a small farming community grow into a full-fledged trade city as time passes in the game world.
